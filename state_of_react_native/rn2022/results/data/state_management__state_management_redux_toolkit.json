            "Redux Toolkit made Redux a lot more convenient to use, but after adopting it on many projects I found that most reducers are very simple and unnecessary. Once you use a library for handling external requests (react-query, apollo), 90% of Redux use cases disappears. Then you're left with some small global stuff, which can be handled by libraries like Zustand/Jotai/whatever else",
