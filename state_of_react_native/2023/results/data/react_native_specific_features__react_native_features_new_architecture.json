            "Libraries I use are yet to migrate to new architecture. i.e. Firebase, React Native PDF",
            "Still a bit unclear how much it will benefit migrating to it. Also unclear if its possible to upgrade if any of the libraries in an app doesnt support it. ",
            "Building in android is a pain in the behind everytime a new package is installed looks like some dependencies are downloaded again",
            "not backward support old libraries, so will not apply it until it's able to support enough libraries",
            "\"Would like to learn\" isn't relevant, I would say - \"Don't have enough business approved time to upgrade\"",
            "Too early to test...",
            "the difficulty with new architecture is that besides the boilerplate for creating/migrating new libs, you need all the libs you use to be migrated",
            "Weird to say \"would use again\", but basically I've tested it out and am familiar with it, but the apps I work on aren't using it yet because not all libraries are yet compatible",
            "\"New Architecture\" is a terrible and confusing name.",
            "We are making a huge effort in migrating our app to support it but the \"brownfield\" nature of it is making things more challenging than expected. Most apps can't just apply the diff directly from the upgrade helper.",
            "Heard of it > Not interested FOR NOW , Many modules are not supported yet and makes it very hard to use it.",
            "it's not relly ready for production",
            "Too experimental for production use ",
            "Not yet though. I think this needs another year or so",
            "Barrier to entry remains high with an ejected app and libraries that aren’t compatible. "
